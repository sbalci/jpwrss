  Wrapper `jamovi` Module for `pwrss` Package Statistical power and minimum
  required sample size calculations for (1) testing a proportion (one-sample)
  against a constant, (2) testing a mean (one-sample) against a constant, (3)
  testing difference between two proportions (independent samples), (4) testing
  difference between two means or groups (parametric and non-parametric tests
  for independent and paired samples), (5) testing a correlation (one-sample)
  against a constant, (6) testing difference between two correlations
  (independent samples), (7) testing a single coefficient in multiple linear
  regression, logistic regression, and Poisson regression (with standardized or
  unstandardized coefficients, with no covariates or covariate adjusted), (8)
  testing an indirect effect (with standardized or unstandardized coefficients,
  with no covariates or covariate adjusted) in the mediation analysis (Sobel,
  Joint, and Monte Carlo tests), (9) testing an R-squared against zero in linear
  regression, (10) testing an R-squared difference against zero in hierarchical
  regression, (11) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for main and interaction
  effects) against zero in analysis of variance (could be one-way, two-way, and
  three-way), (12) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for main and interaction
  effects) against zero in analysis of covariance (could be one-way, two-way,
  and three-way), (13) testing an eta-squared or f-squared (for between, within,
  and interaction effects) against zero in one-way repeated measures analysis of
  variance (with non-sphericity correction and repeated measures correlation),
  and (14) testing goodness-of-fit or independence for contingency tables.
  Alternative hypothesis can be formulated as "not equal", "less", "greater",
  "non-inferior", "superior", or "equivalent" in (1), (2), (3), and (4); as "not
  equal", "less", or "greater" in (5), (6), (7) and (8); but always as "greater"
  in (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14). Reference: Bulus and Polat (2023)
